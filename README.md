# Grayscale_Image_Conversion
A p5.js sketch that you can use in-browser to convert an image into grayscale.

This grayscale image converter uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), but you should be able to launch it straight from your browser using 'index.html'.

Try it online here: https://editor.p5js.org/Andrew_Sink/present/60wLtY_QU

The intent of this program is to get more familiar with the p5.js / Processing language and eventually create a more robust image processor for use with drawing plotters.

KNOWN BUGS:

1. The saved file will resize to the current window size. 

In-browser GUI
